Hello, I am a Mathematician and AI researcher. I completed my master's degree in mathematics from IIT Kanpur and later joined the CDS department at IISC Bangalore to dive into research in data science.
Throughout my research journey, I have concentrated on utilizing various AI-ML techniques and statistical methods to enhance the accuracy of weather predictions such as the Monsoon Onset date. Our Monsoon Onset model successfully forecasts the Monsoon onset solely based on Sea Surface temperature with a lead time of 60 days and an error margin of just 2 days.
Another aspect of my research involves Topological Data Analysis and Change Point detection methods to better understand the dynamics of the Monsoon.
