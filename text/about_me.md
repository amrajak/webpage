# About Me

Greetings! I'm Akanksha M Rajak, a passionate mathematician and AI researcher at the intersection of pure mathematics and cutting-edge data science. My journey in the world of numbers and algorithms has been nothing short of exhilarating, and I'm thrilled to share it with you.

## Academic Journey

My love affair with mathematics began early, but it truly blossomed during my master's degree at the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur. There, I delved deep into the abstract realms of pure mathematics, honing my analytical skills and developing a rigorous approach to problem-solving.

However, the rapidly evolving field of data science beckoned, promising exciting applications of mathematical concepts in the real world. This led me to the Computational and Data Sciences (CDS) department at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore, where I embarked on my doctoral journey.

## Research Focus

At IISc, I've found my niche at the fascinating intersection of mathematics, artificial intelligence, and climate science. My research primarily focuses on two interrelated areas:

1. **AI-Powered Weather Prediction**: 
   I'm leveraging advanced AI and machine learning techniques, combined with robust statistical methods, to revolutionize weather forecasting. Our crown jewel is the Monsoon Onset model, which can predict the onset of the monsoon with remarkable accuracy. Using only Sea Surface Temperature data, we can forecast the monsoon onset 60 days in advance, with an impressive error margin of just 2 days. This work has significant implications for agriculture, water resource management, and economic planning in monsoon-dependent regions.

2. **Topological Data Analysis in Climate Science**:
   I'm also exploring the power of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to unravel the complex dynamics of monsoon systems. By applying TDA and change point detection methods, we're gaining new insights into the underlying structures and patterns of monsoon data. This novel approach allows us to detect subtle changes and transitions in climate systems that traditional methods might miss.

## The Big Picture

My research isn't just about numbers and algorithms; it's about making a tangible impact on society. Accurate monsoon predictions can help farmers plan their crops more effectively, aid in better water resource management, and even save lives by providing early warnings for extreme weather events.

Moreover, by advancing our understanding of climate systems through innovative mathematical techniques, we're contributing to the broader field of climate science. In an era of climate change, this work has never been more crucial.

## Looking Forward

As I continue my research, I'm constantly excited by the potential of interdisciplinary approaches in solving complex real-world problems. I believe that the fusion of pure mathematics, data science, and domain expertise is the key to unlocking new frontiers in scientific research.

I'm always eager to collaborate, share ideas, and learn from fellow researchers and industry professionals. If you're interested in my work or see potential for collaboration, don't hesitate to reach out. Let's push the boundaries of what's possible in data-driven climate science together!
